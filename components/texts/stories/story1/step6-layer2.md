title: Refuge at Mitenne
---

When Spanish missionization efforts ramped up aggressively in the mid 1790s, Mitenne became something of a refuge for those resisting and fleeing the Spanish. Its distance from Santa Cruz, as well as its reputation for being "nestled in the hard-to-reach mountains" (59), this Mitenne-bound fugutive community comprised not only of other Quiroste peoples but also fugitives from other neighboring tribes. The Quiroste's vast territory and influence over key exports may have made them an ideal nation to flee to for protection from the Spanish.
