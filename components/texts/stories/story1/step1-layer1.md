title: The Achistaca
---

Achistaca, according to Rizzo-Martinez, "may very well refer to all the upland Cotoni village sites in a more plural sense," (38) located in between contemporary Little Basin and Buzzard's Roost. Although Spanish baptismal records referred to the Cotoni and Achistaca as two distinct groups, there is reason to believe that the two were actually of the same nation.

Archaeological records have not found village sites at the heart of Big Basin as of yet, though Achistaca's presence in the Little Basin suggests that Indigenous peoples did reside near and around Big Basin.
