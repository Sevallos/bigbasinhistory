title: Regarding Big Basin
---

In the case of Big Basin, it seems that neither the lumber mill companies nor the Sempervirens Club of California knew which peoples may have lived in its redwood forests prior to the Late 19th Century. In several early Sempervirens Club writings, they sometimes reference an idealized image of what Indigenous peoples living in Big Basin might have looked like, though they never had a particular tribal name in mind. In their imaginations, they believed that people must have dwelled in Big Basin as far back as centuries prior to the club's arrival in 1900, not realizing that it's possible the Cotoni may have inhabited the surrounding redwood forests up to around the 1830s. 

Because of this, some club members wrote of history in Big Basin starting with prehistoric geologic shifts and remaining in primeval, unaltered stasis up until the first American woodsman discovering it around the mid-19th Century. Without substantial archaeological evidence, this silence in the history remained largely unchallenged even into the Late 20th Century. The Sempervirens Fund's 1973 _Big Basin_ appeared to have some acknowledgement that Indigenous peoples likely passed through the area. However, it was not until the 1980s that archaeological digs around the Santa Cruz Mountains began to accurately reconstruct the location and peoples of village sites.

Addressing Big Basin's past in this regard allows us to better understand the breathtaking environment that the Sempervirens Club rallied to preserve.
