title: Spanish Missionization
---

The Spanish first landed in northern California in the late 18th Century, and by the 1790s, they began their missionization campaign. Through baptisms and ethnographic questionnaires the missions kept record of (combined with both oral histories and archaeological evidence), historians have been able to reconstruct the Indigenous cutural, political, and economic connections of this region both prior to and after Spanish contact.
