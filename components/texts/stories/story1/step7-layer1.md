title: Hummingbird, Coyote, and Eagle
---

As documented in _We Are Not Animals_, the hummingbird, coyote, and eagle are culturally significant to the Ohlone-speaking nations of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The story passed down through oral traditions was that when the creator finished creating the world, these three were standing at the top of a high mountain during a great flood. "Eagle carried Hummingbird and Coyote and flew away to a still higher mountain," where they remained until the flood ended. In the aftermath, Eagle sent Coyote down from the mountain to live among the humans, and other tales credit Hummingbird with bringing fire to the people.

Various Ohlone-speaking peoples have tales that involve these three animals among others, believing them to have spiritual significance to the land and their way of life. Mount Umunhum, among the tallest peaks in the Santa Cruz Mountains (Mak-Sah-Re-Jah), translates to mean "place of Hummingbird." Many village sites and sacred places of the Santa Cruz Mountains and nearby coasts reflect these shared beliefs.
