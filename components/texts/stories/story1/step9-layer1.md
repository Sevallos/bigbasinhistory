title: Prescribed Burnings and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)
---

The Quiroste, among several other nations, managed their lands through environmental processes including (but not limited to) soil tillage, mulching, irrigation, and prescribed burning. Prescribed burns were critical to many Indigenous peoples for fire control (by clearing excess brush), promoting the growth of specific plants, and creating the open grassland habitats that many of their hunted animals preferred. 

The abundant diversity of plant and animal species in this part of California was the direct result of Indigenous land management. We refer to their land management practices as Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and from recognizing this ecological stewardship, we understand that groups like the Quiroste were actively shaping the land to suit their needs.
