title: Seasonal Migration
---

Oral histories from Cotoni descendants suggest that the coastal villages lived primarily off of shellfish and carried them into the hills during seasonal migrations. Remains of shellfish have been found in archaeological sites in and near Achistaca (by today's Little Basin), supporting the hypothesis that though the Spanish baptismal records called the Cotoni and Achistaca two distinct groups, they were likely the same people. Achistaca itself may possibly refer to multiple upland Cotoni village sites collectively, rather than a single site or separate people.
