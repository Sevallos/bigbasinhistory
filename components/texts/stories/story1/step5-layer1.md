title: A Vast Politically, Culturally, and Economically Interconnected Region
---

Baptismal records from Mission Santa Cruz (as well as others in the San Francisco Bay Area) indicate a significant number of kinships and intermarriages between multiple Indigenous groups around the Santa Cruz Mountains. These relationships oftentimes had political significance among neighboring nations and villages, "facilitating social cohesion throughout the region" (38). In addition to intermarriages, there are multiple records of different nations' representatives traveling together to the Spanish missions for diplomatic meetings and baptisms. The Uypi People, whom lived closest to Santa Cruz when the Spanish arrived, had documented intermarriage connections with nations like the Cotoni (Davenport; Little Basin), the Sayanta (Zayante), and the Chaloctaca (Lexington Reservoir).

Far from geographically isolated nations, this is just one example of how interconnected socially and culturally the peoples of this region were.
