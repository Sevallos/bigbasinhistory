title: Among the Largest Nation in the Region
---

The Quiroste controlled the most territory in this region near the Santa Cruz Mountains and San Francisco Bay Area. In addition to territory, they also controlled two significant resources to Indigenous Californians: Monterey Chert and Olivella snail shell beads. Chert was vital to the creation of many tools and weapons, including spear points, arrowheads, scrapers, and and knives. The Olivella snail shell beads were essential as currency in this part of Indigenous California (as was abalone), apparent by the archaeological evidence that documents these snail shell beads traded throughout California. Through these economic exports, the Quiroste had a significant connection to the rest of the region. Their people were among the first in the Bay Area to receive baptisms, not in Santa Cruz but in San Francisco.

Because of their significant connection to the rest of this Indigenous reason, this mural depicting the Quiroste Village site of Mitenne is helpful in understanding the common cultural practices and beliefs of the other Ohlone-speaking nations nearby. The artist Ann Thiermann potrays multiple spiritual beliefs and common practices to give the viewer a sense of daily life in Mitenne (today known as Quiroste Valley in Año Nuevo State Park).
